This version adds new features on top of 1.6.1:

 * Mockito settings (name, defaultAnswer, extraInterfaces) can be specified during mock creation
 * issue #39: results are now printed to the console as soon as executed
 
And fixes some issues:

 * delayed a MatchResult evaluation when transforming it to a Prop avoid issues with properties implication
 * issue #40: incorrect line number for a failure in a mutable specification
