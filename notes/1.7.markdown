This version adds new features on top of 1.6.1:

 * Mockito settings (name, defaultAnswer, extraInterfaces) can be specified during mock creation
 * issue #39: results are now printed to the console as soon as executed
 * added an implicit function to allow the use of generators in ScalaCheck properties: `forAll(generator) { p => p must matchSomething }`
 
And fixes some issues:

 * delayed a MatchResult evaluation when transforming it to a Prop avoid issues with properties implication
 * issue #40: incorrect line number for a failure in a mutable specification
 * issue #41: missing specification title when using sbt
