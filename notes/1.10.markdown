This version adds new features on top of 1.9.0:

 * added a `skipAllUnless(condition)` to skip examples unless a condition is verified
 * added a `CommandLineArguments` trait to access the command-line arguments and use them to build the specification or to specialize the examples behaviour
 * added a `notoc` argument to avoid generating a table of contents
 * added the possibility to add a `css/specs2-user.css` file to customize the display of the html documentation
 * a specification can be included in another one, to be executed at the same time, and not be displayed: `include(childSpec.hide)` 
 * added the possibility to change the directory where the html documentation is generated: `class S extends Specification { def is = "Guide".title.baseDirIs("guide") ^ end }`
 * improved the error message when there is an `Error` thrown from an Example (see this [StackOverflow question](http://bit.ly/LlSNly))
 
And some fixes:

 * issue 72: fixed a NullPointerException when receiving an `AssertionError` with a null message
 * issue 78: show the exception stacktrace when thrown from a ScalaCheck property
