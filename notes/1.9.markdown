This version adds new features on top of 1.8.2:

 * `isolated` specifications where each example is executed in its own copy of the specification so that all local variables are re-initialized (an example [here](https://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/blob/1.9/src/test/scala/examples/StackIsolatedSpec.scala))
 * improved the documentation showing that `DataTables` can be displayed as examples
 * improved the performance of the `beMatching` matchers
 * `AllExpectations` trait to collect [all the expectations](http://etorreborre.github.com/specs2/guide/org.specs2.guide.SpecStructure.html#All+Expectations) of an example 
 * Mockito can now be used with functions having by-name arguments or implicitly converted arguments
 * added some helper functions and conversions to verify function/partial function parameters with Mockito
 * a `Notifier`/`Exporter` can now be specified as an argument for custom reporting of the specification
 * mutable specifications can now be used as acceptance specifications with: paragraphs and formatting fragments, auto-examples, given/when/then style
 * reworked the User Guide titles for better readability and structure
 * keeping the exact type of an exception happening during the execution of an example for better reporting
 * ScalaCheck properties can now be used inside contexts in a mutable specification
 
And some fixes:

 * fixed issue 61: proper timing of specifications when examples are executed concurrently
 * fixed issue 63: improper inference for `ParserMatchers`
 * fixed issue 64: display of the `>>` operator in the User Guide
 * fixed issue 65: result of and-ed `DataTables`
