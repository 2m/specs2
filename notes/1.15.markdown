New features

 * simplified the acceptance specifications with [interpolated strings](https://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/blob/master/src/test/scala/examples/HelloWorldSpec.scala)
 * simplified way of declaring Given/When/Then specifications with the `FragmentParsers` trait (http://etorreborre.github.com/specs2/guide/org.specs2.structure.GivenWhenThenPage.html)
 * the `Snippets` trait allows to insert compiled code to specifications and to check results
 
Improvements
 
 * when a result is Skipped or Pending in a ScalaCheck property the full property is skipped or pending
