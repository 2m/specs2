This version adds new features on top of 1.5:

 * the link of an included specification in a html report now displays the status of that specification
 * throwing an exception if a null matcher is passed as an expectable
 * added a link to html reports so that only issues will be displayed
  
And some fixes:

 * fixed the issue with -Dcolor=false not being recognized
 * reworked the Given/When/Then specifications indentation so that formatting fragments can now be used
 * fixed a [typechecking issue](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/specs2-users/mYyGuvBYMwI/discussion) with Mockito specifications
 * fixed auto-examples [when no 'end' fragment is used](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/specs2-users/mEpVvVSSqHA/discussion) at the end of the specification
