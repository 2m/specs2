This version adds new features on top of 1.1:

 * Support for `Given / When / Then` style of specification: fully typechecked and integrated with ScalaCheck for random generation of values
 * Additional`Before/After` traits: to easily define a context for each example in a Specification
 * `stopOnFail`: a new argument to stop the execution of a specification in case of a failure or an error
 * `NotifierRunner` executes a specification and notifies a `Notifier` instance of execution events (this is used by the IntelliJ IDEA plugin)
 * scalaz is now provided with the specs2 class and become an optional dependency
